Create Deck class represents a deck of 52 cards. The Deck should maintain which
cards are currently in the deck and never contain duplicated cards. Cards should be 
represented by a string containing their value
(2 - 10 , J, Q, K, A) followed by theri suit (D,H,C,S). For example, the jack of 
clubs would be represented by "JC" and the three of hearts would be represented by "3H".

Your Deck should implement the following methods:

- shuffle(): This method shuffles the cards randomly, in place. You may use the random.shuffle() method to help you do 
                this.
- deal(n): This method removes and returns the last n cards from the deck in a list. If the deck does not contain enough
            cards it returns all the cards in the deck
- sort_by_suit(): This method sorts the cards by suit, placing all the hearts first, diamonds second, clubs third and spades last.
                    The order within each suit (i.e the card values) does not matter. This method should sort the cards in place,
                    it does not return anything.

- contains(card): This method return True if the given card exists in the deck and False otherwise
- copy(): This method returns a new Deck object that is a copy of the current deck. Any modifications made to the new Deck objecet should not affect 
            the deck object that was copied
- get_cards(): This method returns all the cards in the deck in a list. Any modifications to the returned list should not change the Deck object
__len__(): This method returns the number of the cards in the Deck.

Your deck should alwasys start with exactly 52 cards that are distributes across 4 suits and 13 values where there are no duplicate cards.
